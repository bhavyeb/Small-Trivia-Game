Problem statement:
Create a small Trivia game.
Get questions and answers from this API - https://jservice.io/api/random
Show the user the question and keep the answer in memory. Users will enter answers in a text field.
When the user presses the submit button, compare the answer with the one user has entered.
Show a correct or incorrect message as result and then load another question by calling the same API.

Expectations:
Functional components with modularization
Tests with jest (nice to have)
Basic validations must be there
Try to avoid any console warnings. There must not be any console errors.

Submission:
Once you are done, create a public repo on github and push your code.
